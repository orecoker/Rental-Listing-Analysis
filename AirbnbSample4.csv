But there are plenty of bars and restaurants to hangout in this neighborhood! Please check out the section for restaurant/bar recommendations. Smoking in the apartment is strictly prohibited, but you can smoke outside the main entrance of the building. Tuxie (a 5-month old black kitten) is the co-owner of this property. Only consider this place if you are a cat lover! You are more than welcome to pet him and play with him.  Although I love animals, but my cat Tuxie is likely to stressed out by other pets in the property. So unfortunately, bringing your pet is not allowed."
